# Predictive Analytics Model for Threat Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a predictive analytics model tailored for tactical intelligence analysis. It forecasts potential threats or unrest using machine learning techniques such as time series analysis and natural language processing.

### Key Features
- Forecast future events using historical data (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
- Detect potential unrest using text classification and sentiment analysis.
- Scalable pipeline for training and deploying models.
