# Predictive Analytics Model for Threat Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a predictive analytics model tailored for tactical intelligence analysis. It forecasts potential threats or unrest using machine learning techniques such as time series analysis and natural language processing.

### Key Features
- Forecast future events using historical data (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
- Detect potential unrest using text classification and sentiment analysis.
- Scalable pipeline for training and deploying models.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-analytics-model.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd predictive-analytics-model

3. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
4. Preprocess the dataset:
python src/data_preprocessing.py

5. Train the model:
python src/train_model.py

6. Evaluate the model:
python src/test_model.py

7.Predict new outcomes:
python src/predict.py
